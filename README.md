# Pain Metric Analysis
MATLAB functions and scripts to extract and visualize pain and behavioral REDCAP survey data collected alongside Summit RC+S neural data. Initial processing includes
extraction of REDCAP survey data and transformation of data into a data format for analysis, plotting, and visualization.

**Background**: UCSF teams investigating adaptive neurostimulation administered through Summit RC+S devices need an analysis and visualization framework for pain and psychological data.

**Aim**: To synthesize MATLAB functions and scripts for analyzing and visualizing REDCAP surveys that collect pain metrics and behavioral data.

**Collaborators**: Ryan.Leriche@ucsf.edu, Joanna.Lin@ucsf.edu, Ana.Shaughnessy@ucsf.edu, Prasad.Shirvalkar@ucsf.edu (open for more colleagues to join...)
