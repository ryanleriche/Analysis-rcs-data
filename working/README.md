# RC+S Chronic Pain behavioral and electrophysiological analysis


**Background**: The Shirvalkar Lab is investigating adaptive neurostimulation administered through Summit RC+S devices to treat chronic pain. In MATLAB, this repo databases, and preliminarily analyzes our behavioral and neural data--building from the "Analysis-rcs-data" repo to:

* analyze pt pain (over time, into clusters based on several pain scales, and during stimulation paradigms)
  * w/ automated approaches for adaptive DBS development
    
* compare electrophysiological neural spectra from an inpatient sEEG stage to an ambulatory DBS stage


**Collaborators**: Ryan.Leriche@ucsf.edu, Joanna.Lin@ucsf.edu, Ana.Shaughnessy@ucsf.edu, Prasad.Shirvalkar@ucsf.edu (open for more colleagues to join...)
